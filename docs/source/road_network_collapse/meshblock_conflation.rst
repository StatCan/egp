Overview
========

The NGD network needs to be linkable to the new network. This includes individual arcs and BB (meshblock) units.

The EGP and NGD network differences are not limited to the quantity of arcs, but also the shape and alignment of those
arcs. This is why the networks cannot be simply linked arc-to-arc, but require more detailed conflation to reduce
alignment differences. A threshold of 80% is currently used to determine acceptable network alignment and classify
individual meshblock polygons (BBs) as ``conflated`` or ``unconflated``.

.. admonition:: Definition

    ``conflated``: An NGD BB which has >= 80% of its area contained within a single EGP BB.

.. admonition:: Threshold Strictness

    It will not always be possible to achieve the conflation threshold without introducing needless complexity to the
    EGP network. Therefore, the threshold should be treated as a soft restriction and lower values are acceptable so
    long as the NGD BB can be guaranteed to link to a single EGP BB based on majority area occupation, as defined above
    for ``conflation``.

The required actions to resolve ``unconflated`` BBs should follow those outlined in the various validations in
:doc:`meshblock_creation`.

.. admonition:: Definition

    Cardinalities: In a database context, cardinalities refer to the numerical relationships between records of two or
    more datasets.

Explanation of Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /source/_static/meshblock_conflation/qgis_project_layers.png
    :alt: QGIS table of contents.

    Figure 3: QGIS table of contents.

**Layers:**

:``nrn_bo``: Primary editing layer representing NRN roads and ferries, NGD BOs, and added NGD roads.
:``ngd_road``: NGD roads (non-BOs) to be used for identifying roads which are missing from the NRN and are required for
               conflation.
:``meshblock_ngd``: Current NGD BB layer, classified by conflation validity status and labelled with a conflation
                    percentage.
:``meshblock``: New BB layer generated from ``nrn_bo``.
:``Esri Satellite``: Reference layer for recent imagery context.

Conflation Scenarios
====================

.. admonition:: Converting NGD roads to BOs (applies to most scenarios)

    If an NGD road needs to be converted to a BO, copy and paste the NGD feature(s) into the EGP data and set
    ``bo_new=1``. The script will automatically set ``segment_type=3`` for these features, or you can do it yourself.
